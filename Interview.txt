1. What do you think are some advantages of automation testing?
	=> In my opinion, before testing a certain feature or UI I have to define what to do and list test cases.
	=> Automated testing will detect small or large defects and respond quickly,it can execute simple or complex test cases and shorten test case execution tim

2. How do you write test cases?
 =>I will base on the user story to list the suitable test cases for the feature

How familiar are you with Selenium?
	=> Selenium is the auto test the tool check for the web application
		Selenium is used to automate tasks with the browser, or easier to understand, it helps the author to reset the browser tasks like a real person.
		For example: I can program it to automatically launch the browser, open a link, input data, or get info page, upload or download data from a web page.

3. How would you select a test case for automation?
	=> I will write manual test cases firstly, after that I will select test cases which can automate and automate those test case

4. What is test plan ?
	=> Test plan is a document describing the scope, approach, resources and schedule of intended test activities.

5. What is your the most challenges in previous project?  how do you solve it?
	=> In the last project, Business was the hardest thing for me. because i need to understand it to create the right test cases
	=> I fix the problem by i will list the questions related to the problem i don't understand then i will contact the developer to ask, if the developer dont understand i will contact the customer to question

6. When do you create bug report ? 	
	=> When i find diffrence between user story and the return result of the test case.

7. How do you log the Bug Report ? 
	 =>I will check if the error really occurs, then I will write the error on jira 
	=> The bug report includes: the error summary title, the test environment, and the description of the error process.

8. what do you do if developer said that it's not a bug ? 
	=> I will replicate again to make sure that it is a bug, if it is really a bug, I will disucuss with BA about that bug and follow BA's instructions


9. What Is the API testing ?
	=> API testing is a type of software that involves direct testing of applications that establish interfaces 
		and is part of integration testing to determine if the software meets expectations in terms of functionality, 
		reliability, performance, and performance. performance and security or not.

10. How do you write test case for API ? ~ How do you Performance the API testing ?
 => I will be base on user story to list full test cases for API and I will apply it to test automation, when I get expected results from test automation I will take it to compare with the request in the user story.

11. What are testing type do u know ?
 	=> Test types I know:
		Functional testing, Non functional 
		Smoke, Intergation
		System, Regression, Unit test



12. Bug lifecycle
 	+ When tester detects a bug, its status is NEW
	+ then tester report bug and developers agree to fix then switched to IN PROGRESS.
	+ When the bug is fixed, it will be switched to READY FOR TEST. After that, tester will check the bug again, if test fail, tester will report it again and its status will be REOPEN, 
	+ else test pass its status will be DONE. In case developers don't agree that bug, its status will be NEED MORE INFORMATION. 
	+ In case both tester and developer consider that it doesn't a bug, its status will be CLOSED.

13. Some activites 
 => In previous project, i enjoyed some activites such as sprint planning sprint review, sprint respective and daily meeting
	Sprint Planning
        - During sprint planning, the entire scrum team collaborates and discusses the desired high-priority work for the sprint and defines the sprint goal.
       	
	Daily Scrum
	- The development team meets for 15 minutes (or less) every day of the sprint to inspect progress toward the sprint goal.
	- I have to answer three question: what did i do yesterday, what will i do to day, have any blocker (issue)
	Sprint Review
	- During a sprint review, the scrum team invites stakeholders to discuss what was completed during the sprint
	Sprint Retrospective
	- During a sprint retrospective, the scrum team discusses what start doing, keep doing, stop doing.

14. How do you test script ?
	=> Pycharm is a tool for me to script and I create a file with extension .robot
	=> then i base on the test cases i have chosen and use selenium library to test the ui, request the library to test the API

15. What are the benefits of using the Robot Framework ?
 => Easy to set up and use, and it allows to create and run test cases.
 => Any beginner can get start with the robot framework because it is simple and does not require much testing knowledge.
 => All reports are also generated automatically when we run the test script without any other commands

16. What do you understand about test setup and teardown in the context of the robot framework?

17. What is the robot framework ?
	 => Robot Framework is an extensible testing framework to use for acceptance testing phase (AT), acceptance test driven development phase (ATDD) and can be used for automated testing

18. What are the disadvantages of using the robot framework?

19. Differentiate between Robot Framework and Selenium?
	=> - Robot framework: is an open-source automation framework with a wide range of applications, it can use for API testing, web testing and database testing
           - Selenium: is a open-source Web automation testing framework. It's mostly a front-end component and functionality testing tool for browsers

20. Explain the hierarchical structure for arranging test cases in the context of the robot framework ?

21. What are the different types of variables in the context of the robot framework ?
	=> Variables are a key component of Robot Framework, and they can be utilized in almost every test data scenario. 
		They're most typically used as arguments for keywords in the Test Case and Keyword sections, although they're also allowed in all settings.
		 A variable cannot be used to specify a standard keyword name, but the BuiltIn keyword Run Keyword can be used to achieve the same result.
	+ Following are the different types of variables:
		+ Scalar Variables:
		+ List Variables
		+ Dictionary Variables
		+ Dictionary Variables
		+ Environment Variables

22. Differentiate between Robot Framework and Cucumber.
	=> - Robot framework: It is based on the Python programming language. It uses keyword-driven testing to write test cases
           - Cucumber: It is based on the Ruby programming language. It is a behaviour-driven development automation tool. The specifications are written in plain text English, making them understandable to testers, developers or BA.



 
How many test cases have you automated in a day?
 => I think it depends on the Test Scenario. if the situation is complex i can do about 2-3 test cases and otherwise simple i can do more.
