What do you think are some advantages of automation testing?
	=> In my opinion, before testing a certain feature or UI I have to define what to do and list test cases.
	=> Automated testing will detect small or large defects and respond quickly, execute simple or complex test cases, shorten test case execution time

What kinds of frameworks have you worked with?
	 => I used to use robot framework in old project

How do you write test cases?
 => I would read user stories to determine what features it includes and what it does.
	Then I will base on the user story to list the suitable test cases for the feature

How familiar are you with Selenium?
	=> Selenium is the auto test the tool check for the web application

How would you select a test case for automation?

How do you decide which tools to use for automation testing?

What types of tests would you not automate?

What is your the most challenges in previous project?  how do you solve it?
	=> In the last project, Business was the hardest thing for me. because i need to understand it to create the right test cases
	=> I fix the problem by i will list the questions related to the problem i don't understand then i will contact the developer to ask, if the developer dont understand i will contact the customer to question

When do you create bug report ? 	
	=> I think the return result of the test case it is different from the request in the user story

How do you write test case for API ?
 => First, I need to define what kind of API it is, what its function is, and evaluate the complexity.Then I will list the full test cases for the API
Finally I will apply to test automation, when I get expected results from test automation, I take the returned result to compare with request in user story.


How many test cases have you automated in a day?
 => I think it depends on the Test Scenario. if the situation is complex i can do about 2-3 test cases and otherwise simple i can do more.

Bug lifecycle
	+ When tester detects a bug, it's status is NEW

 	+ Testers have to report Bug to project manager for review and give bug to developers

	+ The developer will analyze and fix the bug, the bug will have IN-PROGRESS status. When the bug is fixed, it will notify the tester and the bug has a FIXED status

	+ Tester will check the bug again, if the bug is still present, it will report it to the developer and the bug has RE-OPENED status 
		otherwise the tester will report to the developer and project manager and the bug status is CLOSED


How do you log the Bug ? 
	 => I will check if the error really happened, then I will write the error on jira with a title that summarizes the error, in which environment the bug occurred, 
		the content will describe in detail the process of the error and I Will attach photos or videos for devs to easily fix bugs.

what do you do if developer said that it's not a bug ? 
	 => I will double check the error is really happening then i will ask the BA to see if that BUG happened

Some activites 
 => In previous project, i enjoyed some activites such as sprint planning sprint review, sprint respective and daily meeting
	Sprint Planning
        - During sprint planning, the entire scrum team collaborates and discusses the desired high-priority work for the sprint and defines the sprint goal.
       	- Purpose describes the product goal and also answers questions from the development team about execution and acceptance criteria
	- After rin planing, we create manual test case for defined story
	Daily Scrum
	- The development team meets for 15 minutes (or less) every day of the sprint to inspect progress toward the sprint goal.
	- They describe for each other how their own work is going
	Sprint Review
	- Sprint reviews focus on the product being developed, specifically on the potentially shippable product increment created during the sprint
	- During a sprint review, the scrum team invites stakeholders to discuss what was completed during the sprint
	- The product owner has the option to release any of the completed functionality. 
	Sprint Retrospective
	- Sprint retrospectives focus on the process
	- During a sprint retrospective, the scrum team discusses what start doing, keep doing, stop doing
	- They make tangible plan for how to improve their own process, tool, relationship
