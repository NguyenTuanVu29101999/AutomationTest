What do you think are some advantages of automation testing?
	=> In my opinion, before testing a certain feature or UI I have to define what to do and list test cases.
	=> Automated testing will detect small or large defects and respond quickly,it can execute simple or complex test cases and shorten test case execution time

What kinds of frameworks have you worked with?
	 => I used to use robot framework in old project

How do you write test cases?
 =>I will base on the user story to list the suitable test cases for the feature

How familiar are you with Selenium?
	=> Selenium is the auto test the tool check for the web application
		Selenium is used to automate tasks with the browser, or easier to understand, it helps the author to reset the browser tasks like a real person.
		For example: I can program it to automatically launch the browser, open a link, input data, or get info page, upload or download data from a web page.

How would you select a test case for automation?

How do you decide which tools to use for automation testing?

What types of tests would you not automate?

What is your the most challenges in previous project?  how do you solve it?
	=> In the last project, Business was the hardest thing for me. because i need to understand it to create the right test cases
	=> I fix the problem by i will list the questions related to the problem i don't understand then i will contact the developer to ask, if the developer dont understand i will contact the customer to question

When do you create bug report ? 	
	=> I think the return result of the test case it is different from the request in the user story


How do you log the Bug ? 
	 =>I will check if the error really occurs, then I will write the error on jira with the error summary title, in which environment the error occurs,
		The content will describe in detail the error process and I will attach a photo or video for developers to easily fix it.

what do you do if developer said that it's not a bug ? 
	=> I will replicate again to make sure that it is a bug, if it is really a bug, I will disucuss with BA about that bug and follow BA's instructions


What Is the API testing ?
	=> API testing is a type of software that involves direct testing of applications that establish interfaces 
		and is part of integration testing to determine if the software meets expectations in terms of functionality, 
		reliability, performance, and performance. performance and security or not.



What are testing type do u know ?
 	=> Test types I know:
		Functional testing, Non functional 
		Smoke, Intergation
		System, Regression, Unit test

How do you write test case for API ? ~ How do you Performance the API testing ?
 => I will be base on user story to list full test cases for API and I will apply it to test automation, when I get expected results from test automation I will take it to compare with the request in the user story.


How many test cases have you automated in a day?
 => I think it depends on the Test Scenario. if the situation is complex i can do about 2-3 test cases and otherwise simple i can do more.

Bug lifecycle
 	+ When tester detects a bug, its status is NEW, then tester report bug and developers agree to fix then switched to IN PROGRESS.
	+ When the bug is fixed, it will be switched to READY FOR TEST. After that, tester will check the bug again, if test fail, tester will report it again and its status will be REOPEN, 
	+ else test pass its status will be DONE. In case developers don't agree that bug, its status will be NEED MORE INFORMATION. 
	+ In case both tester and developer consider that it doesn't a bug, its status will be CLOSED.



Some activites 
 => In previous project, i enjoyed some activites such as sprint planning sprint review, sprint respective and daily meeting
	Sprint Planning
        - During sprint planning, the entire scrum team collaborates and discusses the desired high-priority work for the sprint and defines the sprint goal.
       	- Purpose describes the product goal and also answers questions from the development team about execution and acceptance criteria
	- After rin planing, we create manual test case for defined story
	Daily Scrum
	- The development team meets for 15 minutes (or less) every day of the sprint to inspect progress toward the sprint goal.
	- They describe for each other how their own work is going
	Sprint Review
	- Sprint reviews focus on the product being developed, specifically on the potentially shippable product increment created during the sprint
	- During a sprint review, the scrum team invites stakeholders to discuss what was completed during the sprint
	- The product owner has the option to release any of the completed functionality. 
	Sprint Retrospective
	- Sprint retrospectives focus on the process
	- During a sprint retrospective, the scrum team discusses what start doing, keep doing, stop doing
	- They make tangible plan for how to improve their own process, tool, relationship

What are the benefits of using the Robot Framework ?
 => It's easy to set up and use, and it allows you to create and run test cases. Any beginner may get started with the robot framework because it is simple and does not require much testing knowledge.
	 All reports are generated automatically as well when we run test script without any further commands


What do you understand about test setup and teardown in the context of the robot framework?

What is the robot framework ?
	 => Robot Framework is an extensible testing framework to use for acceptance testing phase (AT), acceptance test driven development phase (ATDD) and can be used for automated testing
